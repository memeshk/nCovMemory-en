# Our Team

We are a group of volunteers across the world and spontaneously gather together to translate reports in Chinese media on the COVID-19 outbreak. By translating first-hand reports from the affected areas in China, we aim to offer a panoramic view of the outbreak to the global community.

As translation is of certain originality, we fully respect the volunteer translators’ right to claim authorship. Collectively, the group is credited as "Chengji Translation Team", taking its meaning from two Chinese characters 诚 (chéng; honesty/authenticity) and 记 (jì; memory/documentation/remembrance). We believe that honesty mobilizes goodwill, and authenticity in documentation nurtures sincerity in remembrance. We are committed to producing faithful translations so as to honor all the reporters at the frontline for contributing to this invaluable library of work.
